# Contributing to Generator Doberman

Thanks for contributing to the Generator Doberman!
A couple of quick guidelines for submitting pull requests:

- If you're implementing a new feature, even if it's relatively small, it's
nice to open an issue before you start so that others know what you're working
on and can help make sure you're on the right track.

Thanks again!
